## Part 1 Creating the Webpage

- Create a New Repository:

- On GitHub, create a new repository named ARIA-Accessibility.
Initialize this repository with a README.md file. Clone your new repository to your local machine.
- Develop the Webpage
- Create an index.html file in your repository.

## The webpage should include

- Headings `(<h1>, <h2>)` to structure the content.
- Paragraphs `(<p>)` explaining the purpose of ARIA and web accessibility in your own words.
- A navigation section `(<nav>)` with the role attribute.
- An input field with an aria-label.
- A second input field with an associated `<label>`tag.
- A button with an aria-label.
- A link with a button role attribute See: [ link ]
- Comments in the code explaining the purpose of each ARIA tag used.

## Part 2 Testing and Validation

- Test for Accessibility:
- Use browser tools or online services to test the accessibility of your webpage.
- Make adjustments as necessary based on the feedback from these tools.
- Bonus: Use the Screen Reader that comes with your OS to test your page's ARIA components. [ Tutorial ]

## Part 3: Deployment and Submission

- Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages:

- In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
- Select the branch you want to deploy (usually main).
Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.
Submit Your Work:

- Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
